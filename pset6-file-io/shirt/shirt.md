# CS50 P-Shirt 👕

After finishing CS50 itself, students on campus at Harvard traditionally receive their very own I took CS50 t-shirt. No need to buy one online, but like to try one on virtually?

In a file called `shirt.py`, implement a program that expects exactly two command-line arguments:

- in `sys.argv[1]`, the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to read (i.e., open) as input
- in `sys.argv[2]`, the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to write (i.e., save) as output

The program should then overlay shirt.png (which has a transparent background) on the input after resizing and cropping the input to be the same size, saving the result as its output.

Open the input with `Image.open`, per https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open,

resize and crop the input with `ImageOps.fit`, per https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageOps.html#PIL.ImageOps.fit,

using default values for `method`, `bleed`, and `centering`, overlay the shirt with `Image.paste`, per https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.paste,

and save the result with `Image.save`, per https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save.

The program should instead exit via `sys.exit`:

- if the user does not specify exactly two command-line arguments,
- if the input’s and output’s names do not end in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`, case-insensitively,
- if the input’s name does not have the same extension as the output’s name, or
- if the specified input does not exist.

Assume that the input will be a photo of someone posing in just the right way, like these demos, so that, when they’re resized and cropped, the shirt appears to fit perfectly.

If you’d like to run your program on a photo of yourself, first drag the photo over to VS Code’s file explorer, into the same folder as `shirt.py`. No need to submit any photos with your code. But, if you would like, you’re welcome (but not expected) to share a photo of yourself wearing your virtual shirt in any of CS50’s communities!
