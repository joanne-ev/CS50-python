# Just setting up my twttr 🐦

When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called ***twttr***. In a file called `twttr.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
