# Refueling â›½

In a file called `fuel.py`, reimplement [Fuel Gauge](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/fuel/) from Problem Set 3, restructuring your code per the below, wherein:

- `convert` expects a `str` in `X/Y` format as input, wherein each of `X` and `Y` is an integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage rounded to the nearest int between `0` and `100`, inclusive. If `X` and/or `Y` is not an integer, or if `X` is greater than `Y`, then `convert` should raise a `ValueError`. If `Y` is `0`, then convert should raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- `gauge` expects an `int` and returns a `str` that is:
    - `"E"` if that int is less than or equal to `1`,
    - `"F"` if that int is greater than or equal to `99`,
    - and `"Z%"` otherwise, wherein `Z` is that same `int`.

```python
def main():
    ...


def convert(fraction):
    ...


def gauge(percentage):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called `test_fuel.py`, implement two or more functions that collectively test your implementations of `convert` and `gauge` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_fuel.py
```
